;Problem:
;Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list
;of its neighbors.
;
;OJ's undirected graph serialization:
;
;Nodes are labeled uniquely.
;We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and
;each neighbor of the node.
;
;As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.
;
;The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as
;separated by #.
;
; - First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
; - Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
; - Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.
;
;Visually, the graph looks like the following:
;
;       1
;      / \
;     /   \
;    0 --- 2
;         / \
;         \_/
