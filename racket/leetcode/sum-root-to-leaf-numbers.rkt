;Problem:
;Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path
;could represent a number.
;
;An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.
;
;Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.
;
;For example,
;
;    1
;   / \
;  2   3
;
;The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
;The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
;
;Return the sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
