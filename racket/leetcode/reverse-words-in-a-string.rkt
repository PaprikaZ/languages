;Problem:
;Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.
;
;For example,
;Given s = "the sky is blue",
;return "blue is sky the".
;
;Update (2015-02-12):
;For C programmers: Try to solve it in-place in O(1) space.
;
;Clarification:
;
; - What constitutes a word?
; - A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
; - Could the input string contain leading or trailing spaces?
; - Yes. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
; - How about multiple spaces between two words?
; - Reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.
